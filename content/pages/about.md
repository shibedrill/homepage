Hi! I see you've found my website!

I'm River [she/they/it], a hobbyist systems administrator and programmer. I mainly write CLI software in Rust, but I also work with server infrastructure technology- mainly Proxmox VE, containers, virtual machines, and networking.

My interests include infrastructure, security, systems software, operating systems, cryptography, and user freedom in hardware, firmware, and software.

Hope you enjoy reading my blog posts! I'll update this site with new posts every so often if I find something interesting to ramble about.

Feel free to [contact me](@/pages/contact.md) if you want to chat or work on a project together!
