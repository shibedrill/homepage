Hi! I see you've found my website!

I'm River [she/they/it], a hobbyist systems administrator and programmer. I mainly write CLI software in Rust, but I also work with server infrastructure technology- mainly Proxmox VE, containers, virtual machines, and networking.

My interests include infrastructure, security, systems software, operating systems, cryptography, and user freedom in software.
